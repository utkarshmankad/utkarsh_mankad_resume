This is my one-page resume made using the LaTex template provided by https://github.com/sb2nov/resume. 
The format is neat, crisp and gives liberty to add new sections as per need.
You can fork the project and modify it the way you like.

### Motivation

I wanted to make my resume and learn LaTex meanwhile. Much help from https://github.com/sb2nov/resume
Added few new sections based on my need. Added new font family.
